              Ultimate Goal, a First Tech Challenge (FTC) game. In this game you
              are required to move a set of Wobble Goals (Draidles), and
              Taurus's around the field into final goals. This season we only
              had about 2 weeks to build our robot, but we managed to pull
              though with an Inventive award. Our robot was called Rush, named
              after the rushing that we had to do to get this done. It was
              designed and engineered by Jameson and Jacob, and programmed by
              Gai. It was designed to work around the constraint of the time
              limit we were given, as the parts did not arrive until two weeks
              before the competition
